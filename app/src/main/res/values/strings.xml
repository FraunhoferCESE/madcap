        \n\n4. Limitation of Liability.  Because the App is part of a scientific research and development project undertaken by the University of Maryland and Fraunhofer USA, Inc., both of which are non-profit, educational and scientific organizations, and because Licensor provides the App to the User free of charge, Licensor\'s maximum liability to User or to any other person for damages that result from the use of the App or any failure of the App to function as intended, whether arising under theories of contract, tort or any other theory of liability, is limited to $50.
