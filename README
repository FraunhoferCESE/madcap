using the application:
- pipelining has to be activated to scan and save data
- when you deactive it, no data may be collected
- scan now detects all the data from the selected sensors
- save data to sd card stores the data to the sd card and resets the data count
- data count is the number of sensor data that got scanned but not stored (comparable to the database's table's lines)

mounting the sdcard file
- download and install imdisk virtual disk
- go to the .android/avd folder that's in the same package as the AndroidStudioProjects folder
- select your android virtual device
- right click on sdcard.img and mount as ImDisk Virtual Disk

installing .apk files to the virtual device
- copy your .apk file to the platform-tools folder of your sdk (you can find out your android sdk
    path if you click File -> Project Structure in Android Studio)
- run the android virtual device with Android Studio
- switch into the platform-tools directory with your command line and install the .apk file
    (Windows: abd install "<application name>.apk"

other things
- if you close the emulator directly after clicking save to sd card, the db file will be broken

creating log file using the logcat logger
- open your cmd
- switch to your adb
-windows:
    - abd.exe logcat > filename.txt
- linux:
    - adb logcat| tee filename.txt

get the different probes and the number of datasets with the sqlite browser
- open your .db file
- Execute SQL:
    SELECT name AS Probe, COUNT(name) as 'Number of datasets' from data GROUP BY name;
- for merged database files you have to replace name with probe
